                    <p>Working with a group in BYU-I Video Game Design Society, I was mainly in charge of the games mobility including, dash system and wall jump. The games focus is a "Hack and Slash", which are typically more fast paced games. Keeping this in mind I made sure to balance the timing between dashes and how powerful of a wall jump we needed. I also took into consideration that another member was in charge of a grappling hook, and how that would affect my design.</p>
