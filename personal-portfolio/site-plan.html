My passion for the field involves game creation and design as I hope to one day join the industry. I am also seeking to learn more in AI and pursue a machine learning certfificate. I love a good challenge and take any opportunity to learn more and be creative!

        Experience/Education: Unity introductory course through Arapahoe High School, BYU-I Computer Science major, Video Game Design Society
        Skills: Communication, Team-Building, Interpersonal skills, Basic Javascript, HTML, Python, C#, Organization, Initiative

      <h3>Mobility in Games</h3>
      <p>
        Working with a group in BYU-I Video Game Design Society, I was mainly in charge of the games mobility including, dash system and wall jump. The games focus is a "Hack and Slash", which are typically more fast paced games. Keeping this in mind I made sure to balance the timing between dashes and how powerful of a wall jump we needed. I also took into consideration that another member was in charge of a grappling hook, and how that would affect my design.

      <h3>Respawn System(In Progress)</h3>
      <p>
        For my groups project I am currently working on a respawn system so that when our Character dies they have a place to come back to and save progress. I landed on doing a collision based checkpoint that the player can be respawned to so that they wouldn't have to worry about hitting a checkpoint manually while surviving.
